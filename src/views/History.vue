      | The beginning of the American Civil War, in 1861, led to the organization of military
      | forces in Colorado Territory. In March 1862, the Colorado volunteers defeated a Confederate
      | Army from Texas in the Battle of Glorieta Pass, New Mexico by destroying their supply
      | wagons, forcing them to retreat. The Confederates returned to Texas, and the First Regiment
      | of Colorado Volunteers returned to Colorado Territory. They were then mounted as a home
      | guard under the command of Colonel John Chivington. Chivington and Colorado territorial
      | governor John Evans adopted a hard line against Indians, whom settlers accused of stealing
      | livestock. Without any declaration of war, in April 1864, Colorado soldiers began attacking
      | and destroying a number of Cheyenne camps, the largest of which included about 70 lodges,
      | about 10% of the housing capacity of the entire Cheyenne nation.[14] On May 16, 1864, a
      | detachment under Lieutenant George S. Eayre crossed into Kansas and encountered Cheyenne in
      | their summer buffalo-hunting camp at Big Bushes, near the Smoky Hill River. Cheyenne chiefs
      | Lean Bear and Star approached the soldiers to signal their peaceful intent, but they were
      | shot down by Eayre's troops.[15] This incident touched off a war of retaliation by the
      | Cheyenne in Kansas.

      | Damn any man who sympathizes with Indians! ... I have come to kill Indians, and believe it
      | is right and honorable to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians. ... Kill and
      | scalp all, big and little; nits make lice.
    p Col. John Milton Chivington
